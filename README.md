# Twitter_Trump_RussianBots
An Analysis of Russian Bots and Trump on Twitter.

Feel free to download the jupyter notebook and run it. Notice I use a few packages you'll have to  download. 

Parts created from DS 100 Project. Also uses VADER analysis tools. 

Bot Analysis done as extra add on. This part is still in progress. Have some very interesting result so far. The crazy part is this only covers 3000 accounts--there were tens of thousands that Twitter deleted. Unfortunately, I could not find any Cached versions in the time I had. However, reach out to me if you happen to have more data on them!

Hoping for more time once school gets a little less busy!

An Analysis of Trump and associated Russian Bots on Twitter. The main file to see is Trump and Russian Bot Tweet Analysis.ipynb

You can simply look at the notebook on github instead of downloading and running it since it already displays the output. Of course, feel free to download the jupyter notebook and run it. Notice I use a few packages you'll have to download. 

The bot analysis is still in progress. There was a really great dataset I found, but its still in progress. I have some very interesting result so far. The crazy part is this only covers 3000 accounts--there were tens of thousands that Twitter deleted. Unfortunately, I could not find any cached versions in the time I had. However, reach out to me if you happen to have more data on them!

You can find most of my conclusions within the .ipnyb file.

Hoping for more time once school gets a little less busy!
